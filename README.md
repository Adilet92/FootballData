Football/Soccer Data for Everyone
============

Football/Soccer data for anyone to use. I save them here as I find them or build the files.

See <http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/guide-to-football-and-soccer-data-and-apis/> for a more complete list of soccer data available online.

Data is in **CSV**, and **JSON** format but will accept any structured format file for contribution.

**Files and datasets will move and schemas will change. Fork the project if you need a snapshot.**

Available Data/Schema:
- JSON Port of [openFootballData](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/tree/master/openFootballData) text files
  - work in progress. The most useful is probably openFootballData/games.json
- [All Leagues](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/blob/master/Leagues.csv)
- [All Teams/Clubs](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/blob/master/Teams.csv)
- [EPL Players in JSON](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/tree/master/espn) - ESPN
 - now that the ESPN API is retired for the public here is a cache of 2014 EPL Players
- [Football stadiums with geographic coordinates](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/blob/master/stadiums-with-GPS-coordinates.csv) -  [source](http://opisthokonta.net/?p=619)
