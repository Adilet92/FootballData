Football (Soccer) Data for Everyone
============

Football/Soccer data for anyone to use. I save them here as I find them or build the files. Data is in mostly csv and json formats.

See [Guide to Football/Soccer data and APIs](http://www.jokecamp.com/blog/guide-to-football-and-soccer-data-and-apis/) for a more complete list of soccer data available online.

**Files and datasets will move and schemas will change. Fork the project if you need a snapshot.**

**Please add your data sets. We need more data.**

## Files

- [FA Premier League Tables (1992 to 2015)](tables/)
- JSON Port of [openFootballData](https://github.com/jokecamp/FootballData/tree/master/openFootballData) text files
  - work in progress. The most useful is probably openFootballData/games.json
- [All Leagues](Leagues.csv)
- [All Teams/Clubs](Teams.csv)
- [EPL Players in JSON](espn) - ESPN
 - now that the ESPN API is retired for the public here is a cache of 2014 EPL Players
- [Football stadiums with geographic coordinates](stadiums-with-GPS-coordinates.csv) -  [source](http://opisthokonta.net/?p=619)
